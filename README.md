# CLIP Model Fine-Tuning on Food Image Caption Dataset

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the CLIP model on a custom dataset consisting of food images paired with textual captions. The goal is to train the CLIP model to learn a shared representation between images and their corresponding text descriptions.

## Introduction
This project involves fine-tuning the CLIP model (clip-vit-base-patch32) using a dataset of food images and their corresponding captions. The CLIP model is a powerful model that learns to understand images and text in a shared latent space. Fine-tuning is performed to adapt the model's pre-trained features to this specific task.

## Project setup
To set up the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face transformers and datasets libraries
- torchvision for data augmentation
- tqdm for progress tracking
